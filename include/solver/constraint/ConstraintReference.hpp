/** A consistent reference to a Constraint.
 * Constraints are stored in vectors that can change size. If a vector has to allocate more memory, any pointers or references
 * to its contents are invalidated. This becomes a problem for constraints that are dynamically added and removed (like collision constraints).
 * 
 * By storing a pointer to the container and its index, we can ensure that even if the vector changes sizes, we still have a valid
 * reference to the Constraint.
 * 
 * There is a performance hit by accessing the constraint through the constraint vector rather than with direct pointer, and since accessing
 * the constraint for its current value and gradient is done thousands of times every time step, this becomes slightly significant (~4-5% slower).
 * 
 * But, for now I think the flexibility (and not having to worry about pre-allocating enough space in the constraint vectors) outweighs the slight cost.
 * 
 * TODO: Generalize ConstraintReference (there is nothing here that is specific to constraints).
 * TODO: Have a monitored vector class that can have "references" registered to it. When it changes size it notifies each reference to update (somehow).
